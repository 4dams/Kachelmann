## Note

All the code you see here was made for educational purposes and not for a "download and run" application/bot.
If you want to run a version of the bot yourself, you will have credit me and this repository. **This code is also licensed under the MIT license.**

## Getting Started

If you want to receive your own weather reports, just join the official Kachelmann Discord-Server here and send Kachelmann(#9991) a message.</br>Just say "hi" or "Hello!" to him, he will then tell you what to do! :)

**You can also invite him to your own server via [this link](https://goo.gl/rWEf1L) and add timed channel messages! Just invite him and say hello to him in a private message!**

## Upcoming features:

- [ ] Units support (Metric and Imperial)
- [ ] Command to list all list entries
- [ ] Admin command to see complete list, or get link to complete online list
